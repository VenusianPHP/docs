# Drawing and refreshing

The four-bit FormatSpec, transmit(), the refresh sequence, sleep, timings.

## FormatSpec

`ROW_MAJOR`, `B4`, `MSB_FIRST`, palette with codes: BLACK 0, WHITE 1, YELLOW 2, RED 3, BLUE 5, GREEN 6.[^ink] Two pixels a byte, left in the high nibble, rows padded to a byte. Surface's `epaper()` framebuffer in this spec stores exactly that and starts as paper (`11`); checked: `K W Y R B G` → `01 23 56`.

## transmit()

Whole frames only (origin 0, 0; full size), else `wholeFrameOnly`; bytes = ceil(w / 2) × h; `10` + frame.[^panel]

## refresh() / sleep()

`refresh()`: `04` + BUSY → `06` refresh booster (`6F 1F 17 27`) → 200 ms → `12 00` + BUSY → `02 00` + BUSY. Every BUSY wait settles 200 ms after BUSY rises, as the vendor does. PARTIAL → `unsupportedRefreshMode`. `sleep()` → `07 A5`; next `boot()` resets.

## Live reference

Pi 5, 10 MHz, 400 × 600: frame built and packed through Surface 377 ms (120 000 bytes), transmit 107 ms, refresh 20.1 s; six colour bands, white marker and black border as drawn.
