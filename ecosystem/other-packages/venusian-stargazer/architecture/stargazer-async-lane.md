# Stargazer async lane

get() blocks; async() returns a loop promise of the same DTOs; DTO link-followers return Promise<Response>.

## Two lanes, one hydrator

`get()` sends through `app('http')` (or the Factory on `NasaClient`), blocks, hydrates. Non-2xx throws `StargazerException`; `status()` is the HTTP status (null when no response was involved).[^pending][^exception]

`PendingNasaRequest` carries a `NasaPayload`: JSON (decoded, DTO class or Closure), XML (text to a Closure; gzip asked), BYTES (the `Response`, or a Closure over it). `timeout(seconds)` sets that request's Http timeout (default 30 s); an empty query is left off so a query written into the path survives.[^pending]

`async()` sends through the same Factory's loop driver and returns `Voyager\Contracts\IOPools\Promise`. Fulfils with what `get()` returns; rejects with what `get()` throws. No loop bound on the Factory → `StargazerException::loopNotBound()`.[^pending][^exception]

`wait()` on the main stack borrows the loop. Inside `$loop->async()` it suspends the fiber.

## Link-follows

`AstronomyPicture::render(bool $hd = false): ?Promise` — null on an embed day. `EpicImage::render(EpicCollection, EpicImageType = PNG): Promise`. `ImageLocation::fetch(): Promise` — spaces encoded as `%20` at the wire. Each fulfils with the Http `Response`; `body()` is the bytes.

## Call names

`callName()` is a label only (`stargazer.<family>.<endpoint>`). Nothing coalesces on it.

[^pending]: PendingNasaRequest
[^exception]: StargazerException
